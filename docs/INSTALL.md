# 🚀 Installation Guide

Install and configure the **Chrome Devtools Advanced MCP** server for your AI
assistant (VS Code, Cline, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, …).

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 18**
- **Google Chrome** installed in a standard location (Edge works too on
  Windows) — the server launches it with your real profile and connects over
  the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
- Windows, macOS or Linux.

> No manual Chrome flags are needed anymore. The server launches Chrome itself
> (`launch_chrome_with_profile`) with a *shadow copy* of your profile so you
> can keep browsing normally while the AI works in a separate window.

## Option A — Run from npm (recommended for users)

Add this server to your MCP client configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`,
Cline settings, `claude_desktop_config.json`, …):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools-advanced-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-advanced-mcp", "--port=9222"]
    }
  }
}
```

1. Save and **restart your assistant** (Ctrl+R in VS Code).
2. When the AI first uses a tool, approve it (**Always Allow**).
3. Ask: *"Launch Chrome with my default profile"* — this runs
   `launch_chrome_with_profile`.

Ports: use any free port (`--port=9222` is the default). The debug port is
only reachable from localhost and uses an origin allow-list — web pages cannot
hijack it.

## Option B — Run from source (for developers / contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eddym06/chrome-devTools-advanced-mcp.git
cd chrome-devTools-advanced-mcp
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js --port=9222
```

Add it to your client using the local entry point:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools-advanced-mcp-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/repo/dist/index.js", "--port=9222"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Useful commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Clean TypeScript build into `dist/` |
| `npm test` | Vitest unit + in-memory integration suite |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (flat config) |
| `npm run docs:check` | Verifies guides never reference non-existent tools |
| `npm run pack:check` | Build + `npm pack --dry-run` to inspect the tarball |
| `npm run dev` | `tsc --watch` |

**Real-Chrome E2E (optional):** on a machine with Chrome installed, run
`CHROME_MCP_E2E=1 npm test` — it launches a headless Chrome and exercises the
real MCP protocol against it.

## First-run checklist

1. Server starts → logs `[MCP] chrome-devtools-advanced-mcp vX starting...`.
2. `get_browser_status` → not connected (expected before launch).
3. User asks to open Chrome → AI calls `launch_chrome_with_profile`
   (`profileDirectory: "Default"`).
4. `manage_tabs` (`action:"list"`) returns the open tabs.
5. Call `show_advanced_tools` only when a task needs the advanced toolset.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No Chrome browser detected"** → call `launch_chrome_with_profile` first;
  the server never auto-launches a window.
- **Chrome doesn't start** → the log file is
  `%TEMP%/chrome-mcp-debug.log` (Windows) / `/tmp/chrome-mcp-debug.log`
  (macOS/Linux). Make sure Chrome is not blocked by policies on your machine.
- **VS Code "Tool disabled by user"** → reload VS Code (Ctrl+R), then choose
  **Always Allow** when the tool is invoked again.
- **Connection refused** → check the port is free and matches the `--port`
  argument; run `get_browser_status` to confirm the state.
- **Cookie values look redacted** → by design: pass `includeValues:true` to
  `get_cookies` / `export_session` / `manage_browser_session` when you truly
  need them.

## Security notes

- Navigation is limited to `http(s)`; `file://` is blocked unless the server
  runs with `CHROME_MCP_ALLOW_FILE_URLS=1` (local testing only).
- HAR exports and downloads are sandboxed to your working directory / temp
  folder.
- The CDP debug port binds to localhost with an origin allow-list.
- Optional: `CHROME_MCP_CONFIRM=on` requires an explicit `_confirm:true`
  argument for destructive tools; `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` controls protocol log noise.

See [USAGE_GUIDE.md](USAGE_GUIDE.md) for the full workflow documentation and
[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) for the complete tool reference.
