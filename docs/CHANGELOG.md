## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-19

### 🔒 Security
- **CDP debug port no longer open to the web.** Chrome is launched with a restrictive
  `--remote-allow-origins` allowlist (`localhost`/`devtools://`) instead of `*`. The MCP server
  connects without an Origin header, so it is unaffected, but no webpage can hijack the debug port
  to read cookies, run JS or navigate to `file://` anymore (`src/chrome-connector.ts`).
- **URL allow-list on navigation.** `browser_action`/`manage_tabs`/all smart-workflow navigation
  tools validate URLs (http/https, plus `about:blank`/`chrome://newtab/`). `file://` is blocked by
  default (`CHROME_MCP_ALLOW_FILE_URLS=1` re-enables for local testing) — closes the arbitrary
  local-file read primitive (`src/utils/helpers.ts`).
- **Sandboxed file output.** HAR exports and downloads resolve inside the working directory or temp
  folder only; filenames are sanitized (`src/utils/file-storage.ts`, used by `export_har_file`,
  `download_file`).
- **Cookie values hidden by default.** `get_cookies`, `export_session` and
  `manage_browser_session` redact cookie values unless `includeValues=true` is passed; import/load
  skip valueless cookies with an explicit message instead of silently writing empty cookies.
- Removed a `console.log` that ran inside the stdio process and would corrupt the JSON-RPC stream
  (`add_advanced_interception_pattern` now logs to stderr).
- JS-string interpolation of URLs/scopeURLs hardened (`JSON.stringify`) in `resend_network_request`,
  `test_api_endpoint`, `unregister_service_worker`, `update_service_worker`.

### 🛠 Reliability
- **Interception enable/disable now happen on the SAME CDP session** (Fetch domain state is
  session-scoped). Previously `disable_response_interception` / `stop_capturing_network_requests`
  disabled a different session — a silent no-op that could freeze the page on the next matching
  request. All enable paths now store their owning session + listener unsubscribe handles, and every
  disable/modify/continue/clear tears down through that owner.
- **Mock endpoints work together.** Creating mocks refreshes the Fetch pattern set with ALL mock
  patterns and keeps ONE listener per tab (previously each mock replaced the last one and stacked
  listeners); delete/clear re-sync or detach correctly. Slow mocks (latency > timeout) no longer
  time out and silently fall through.
- **WebSocket capture** has bounded buffers (200 connections / 1000 messages) and its disable tool
  detaches listeners + disables the domain. `send_websocket_message` no longer reports false success
  (CDP cannot push frames into an open WebSocket; it now hooks new connections and reports honestly).
- **HAR fixes:** `stop_har_recording → export_har_file` flow works (the finished recording is parked
  instead of deleted); creator version reads `package.json`; queryString and response content size
  are populated; entry `time` uses monotonic deltas instead of subtracting wall-time from a
  monotonic clock; entries are capped.
- **Per-tool timeout backstop** (120s) so a hung CDP call can never leave an MCP request pending
  forever (`src/server.ts`); `print_to_pdf`, `CDP.List` liveness probes and reload waits got explicit
  timeouts.
- **Navigate/load race fixed** in five smart-workflow tools and `browser_action` reload: the one-shot
  `loadEventFired` is now subscribed BEFORE navigation is triggered (awaited after → hang on fast
  pages).
- **Lifecycle:** `close_browser`/server shutdown kill a Chrome that THIS server launched (no more
  orphan browsers with open debug ports between restarts); module capture/interception state resets
  on browser disconnect; `connect()` closes a previous live client; process-death cleanup is
  re-entrancy-guarded and closes persistent clients; default tab selection prefers real pages over
  service-worker targets.
- **Stealth script** now reports `navigator.webdriver=false` (real Chrome value), keeps the
  fingerprint seed stable per origin during a session, and removed the hard-coded
  `platform:'Win32'`/Intel-GPU/screen spoofs that contradicted the real environment (a self-inflicted
  detection signal on non-Windows/non-Intel machines).

### 🧹 Housekeeping
- `package.json`: clean build (`dist` wiped before `tsc`), `files: ["dist"]`, `types`, `pack:check`;
  deleted the stale `package/` build duplicate and the outdated `verify-tools.ts` dev script.
- New unit tests for URL validation, filename sanitization and the output sandbox
  (`src/tests/security.test.ts`); validated with a real-Chrome headless E2E smoke.

### 📖 Docs (Phase 2)
- `docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md` rewritten against the current (v1.4) consolidated tool vocabulary
  (no more `navigate`/`click`/`type`/`list_tabs`/`enable_network_interception`/`get_har_entries`),
  with the action-enum tools, resources/prompts and the security defaults.
- `docs/TOOLS.md` added: complete machine-checked reference of all 90 tools (core vs advanced).
- `docs/INSTALL.md` rewritten in English with the current package name/version, npx usage and no
  machine-specific absolute paths; `docs/mcp-config-example.json` is now a reusable npx template.
- `scripts/validate-docs.mjs` + `npm run docs:check`: fails CI/build docs whenever a guide cites a
  tool that does not exist (guards against the v1.0→v1.4 drift class). CI now runs this step.

### ✨ Phase 3 — MCP 2026 polish
- **Structured output:** shared loose output schemas (`src/schemas.ts`, `success` required +
  passthrough) for ~35 high-traffic tools → the SDK validates results and forwards typed
  `structuredContent` (`outputSchema` declared next to handlers still wins).
- **Progress notifications:** tool calls that pass `_meta.progressToken` receive live
  `notifications/progress` (0/100 wrapper + granular stages during `launch_chrome_with_profile`).
  Long handlers call `reportProgress()` from `utils/log.ts`.
- **Standardized logging:** server → client `logging/message` via `sendLoggingMessage`
  (`utils/log.ts`), gated by `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` (default `info`).
- **Resource completions:** `chrome://tab/{tabId}/…` resources now autocomplete live tab IDs.
- **User-confirmation gate (optional):** `CHROME_MCP_CONFIRM=on` requires `_confirm:true` for
  destructive tools (`clear_cookies`, `delete_cookie`, `import_session`,
  `unregister_service_worker`, `clear_all_mocks`, …) until hosts support full MCP elicitation.
- **Trusted interaction:** `perform_interaction` clicks use real CDP mouse events at the element
  center (with visibility/actionability checks, synthetic fallback via `mode`), typing uses
  `Input.insertText` on a focused/selected field; `fill_form` uses the native value setter so
  React/Vue controlled inputs register changes.
- **Stealth per tab:** the stealth script now auto-applies to every NEW/activated tab (per-target
  guard prevents duplicate registration) — not just the first tab.
- **HAR conformance:** central `utils/har.ts` (`createHarLog`, guaranteed HAR 1.2 shape, creator
  version from package.json), CDP ResourceTiming → HAR timings mapping, case-insensitive
  `redirectURL`; unit-tested.
- **Service workers:** `unregister_service_worker` / `update_service_worker` use the CDP
  `ServiceWorker` domain → work for any scope, not only the current tab origin.
- **CI/release:** publish workflow on `v*` tags (lint + docs:check + build + test + pack dry-run +
  `npm publish --provenance`); E2E suite extended with real interception (`enable →
  capture → disable`) and HAR recording/export against a local HTTP server.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-19

### ✨ MCP Resources

- `chrome://tab/{tabId}/html`, `chrome://tab/{tabId}/screenshot`, `chrome://tab/{tabId}/har` — current tab state exposed as listable/cacheable resources instead of only one-shot tool results (`src/resources.ts`).

### ✨ MCP Prompts

- `audit-accessibility`, `debug-console-errors`, `scrape-table` — pre-baked task templates that instruct the calling LLM to chain this server's own tools (`src/prompts.ts`).

### ✨ Explicit output schemas

- `get_html`, `screenshot`, and `manage_tabs` now declare a Zod `outputSchema`; the SDK validates every non-error return against it and forwards typed `structuredContent` instead of relying on the generic best-effort passthrough used by the rest of the tools.

### ✨ New tools

- `download_file` — clicks a download trigger, enables `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` for the call, and returns the saved file path.
- `fill_form` — fills multiple fields (text/select/checkbox, auto-detected) in one call instead of N `perform_interaction` calls.
- `run_performance_audit` — Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS) and basic timing (TTFB, FCP, long tasks, JS heap) via `PerformanceObserver`.
- `emulate_network_conditions` — throttle to Slow 3G / Fast 3G / 4G / offline (or custom values) via `Network.emulateNetworkConditions`.
- `get_indexed_db` — list IndexedDB databases, or read records from every object store in one.

### 🔒 Isolation fix

- `test_with_different_cookies` previously mutated the *real* tab's live cookies (save → overwrite → navigate → best-effort restore), meaning a crash mid-run could leave the user's actual session in the test's cookie state. It now runs inside a throwaway Playwright `browser.newContext()` — a separate cookie jar/storage that never touches the real profile. The now-meaningless `restoreOriginal` parameter was removed.

### 🧹 Housekeeping

- `.npmignore` was letting `assets/logo.png` (4.5MB) and `recordings/demo_recording.har` (86KB) into every published tarball — neither is needed at runtime (GitHub/npm render README images straight from the repo, not the tarball). Published package size: 4.7MB → 238KB.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-19

### 🚀 Modernization

- Migrated the server from the low-level `Server` API to `McpServer.registerTool`, dropping the ~70-line hand-rolled Zod→JSON-Schema converter in favor of the SDK's own conversion.
- Added MCP tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`, `title`) across all tools, derived from naming convention with explicit overrides for composite/lifecycle tools (see `src/tool-annotations.ts`).
- `show_advanced_tools` / `hide_advanced_tools` now use the SDK's native `RegisteredTool.enable()/disable()` (auto-sends `notifications/tools/list_changed`) instead of a manual boolean flag + manual notification call.
- Tool results now include `structuredContent` alongside the text block where the handler returns a plain object.
- Upgraded to Zod v4, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30, Playwright 1.62.
- Replaced hand-rolled `escJS` string-quote escaping (used when interpolating selectors into `Runtime.evaluate` expressions) with `JSON.stringify`, which correctly escapes all cases instead of just backslash/quote.

### 🐛 Fixes

- `get_accessibility_tree` was registered under the same name in both `capture.ts` and `network-accessibility.ts`; the weaker duplicate (capture.ts) is removed.
- `chrome-connector.ts` waited 3s twice in a row during launch verification (a copy-paste duplication), doubling launch latency for no reason.
- Server-reported version now reads from `package.json` at runtime instead of being hardcoded separately (was silently out of sync).

### ✨ New tools

- `get_console_logs` — reads buffered `console.log/warn/error/info/debug` output and uncaught exceptions for a tab; capture starts automatically on first call.
- `clear_console_logs` — clears the buffer without reading it.

### 🧹 Housekeeping

- Removed `src/tools/advanced-network.backup.ts` (1100+ lines of dead code) and the stray `package/` directory (leftover `npm pack` artifacts) from version control.
- Added `eslint.config.js` (flat config) — `npm run lint` was previously broken (ESLint 9 requires flat config, none existed).
- Added `vitest` with a unit suite (`src/tests/helpers.test.ts`), a registry regression test guarding against duplicate tool names (`src/tests/registry.test.ts`), and a full protocol-level integration test using an in-memory MCP client (`src/tests/server.integration.test.ts`).
- Added GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint + build + test on Node 20 and 22.
- Split `index.ts` into `registry.ts` (pure tool aggregation) and `server.ts` (McpServer assembly) so both are unit-testable without booting stdio transport.
